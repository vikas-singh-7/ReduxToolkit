install react redux    to connect the redux with react we use react redux 
insatll redux toolkit    redux toolkit is an easy approach for state managemnets to tell redux toolkit "okay you have to connect with react we use react redux " 

"since a redux is a statemanagement libraray , it has a single source of truth ie.Store which holds all the states and things which component needs and which cpmponents will change "

now after instalation make a store "configureStore form redux toolkit"


after the creatio of store make the app or components which needs store wrapp them in provider form react redux and pass store which we have created  as prop4

now make a feature folder or make a slice "  a slice is part of code which manage a particular part of your application like if a detail section is avaulable on ur applicatio , we can make a dedicated slice for that , which manages the state and data of that feature or part of our application "

lets create a slice for details :P

export its reducer and combine reducer 

now import its combine reducer to store


now make a componnet and try to access the state from the store

wooo we achived the state of the store by useSelector hook when we use it , it automatically target store so we say ok from state of state get the state of the particular slice 


now lets try to dispath some changes :P it will be fun :O)


to dispatch some changes or to change state , we use usedispatch hook from redux


we pass our reducers that are the ageng for making change in slice in usedispatch and we dispatch changes
